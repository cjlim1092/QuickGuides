        <h1>Quick Guides for Distance Learning</h1>

        <div id="misson">
            <p>Distance learning is hard. It is even harder when you have a problem that you have to troubleshoot for your kid while you are also trying to work from home. This guide is written with parents in mind, trying to make distance learning a little bit easier.</p>
            <p>Each guide is a 20 second GIF, click on the gif you want to see to make it bigger. In the future I will add written guides for essential zoom skills.</p>
